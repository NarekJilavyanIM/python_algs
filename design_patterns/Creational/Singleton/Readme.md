This is the "Singleton" design pattern implementation in python.
The purpose of it is to make a class which will have only one instance
and that instance will be given global access.

Suppose that we need only one instance of the class for all the clients.
E.g. we have some program and we want to store some logs into a file.
In the example we will use a string instead of a file for simplicity.
